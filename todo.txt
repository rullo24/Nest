todo:
- Free all heaped memory in [main.c]
- Create another linked list that holds all malloced memory 
    --> This should be iterated through for freeing memory at the end of the program
        NOTE: Need to fall back and remove memory from the LL when 
- Set the address bar to show the current dir
    --> Remove the current dir display when clicked on [toolbar.c]
- Address bar requires buttons for each parent dir above the current
- need to free the memory that is taken by the buttons for the data
- Setup back and forward buttons for going up and down the file tree
- Need to free memory used by the PTRS_NESTDIRCHANGEDATA structs that are assigned to each button
    --> Can currently only deallocate the button that is clicked (having this in the linked list button data would allow a looping deallocation method)
- Dellocate memory used by _changeDirFromAddrBarSpecified [keyboard.c] -> PTRS_NESTDIRCHANGEDATA struct
    > This is located [toolbar.c]
